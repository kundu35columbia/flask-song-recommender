# Music Recommendation Chatbot

This project is a **music recommendation chatbot** that provides personalized song suggestions based on user input and emotional context. The system leverages state-of-the-art models like **EmoRoBERTa** for emotion analysis and integrates item-based collaborative filtering to generate accurate and diverse music recommendations. The chatbot is deployed and accessible at **[flask-song-recommender.onrender.com](https://flask-song-recommender.onrender.com)**.

## Features

- **Emotion-Based Recommendations**:  
  Utilizes EmoRoBERTa to analyze user dialogues and infer emotional states (e.g., joy, sadness, anger), aligning recommendations with the userâ€™s mood.

- **User Preference Filtering**:  
  Allows users to provide a favorite song or artist to personalize recommendations. The system also supports filtering by emotion alone when no preferences are provided.

- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**:  
  Recommends similar songs by analyzing audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo, ensuring both personalization and diversity.

- **Dynamic and Scalable Deployment**:  
  The chatbot is hosted on **Render**, ensuring robust scalability and low latency for real-time user interactions.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:  
   Users interact with the chatbot through a web interface, providing inputs such as mood, song, or artist preferences.

2. **Emotion Analysis**:  
   User conversations are analyzed using EmoRoBERTa to determine emotional states.

3. **Filtering and Recommendations**:  
   - If a song or artist is provided, the system anchors the recommendations around this input.
   - If no preferences are given, emotion-based filtering drives the recommendations.
   - The final output consists of five songs: one matching the user's input and four similar tracks.
